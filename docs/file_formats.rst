File Formats
============

This section documents the supported file formats that can be imported by ``batch import``.
In the case of the non-native TSV format, this section documents how the file format maps to the information handled and stored by clinvar-this.

--------------------------
Small Variant TSV (Native)
--------------------------

The following headers are required.
Clinvar-this will recognize the TSV file format based on these headers.

- ``ASSEMBLY`` - the assembly used, e.g., ``GRCh37``, ``hg19``, ``GRCh38``, ``hg38``
- ``CHROM`` - the chromosomal position without ``chr`` prefix, e.g., ``1``
- ``POS`` - the 1-based position of the first base in ``REF`` column
- ``REF`` - the reference allele of your variant
- ``ALT`` - the alternative allele of your variant
- ``OMIM`` - the OMIM id of the carrier's condition (not the OMIM gene ID), e.g., ``619325``.
  Leave empty or use ``not provided`` if you have no OMIM ID.
- ``MOI`` - mode of inheritance, e.g., ``Autosomal dominant inheritance`` or ``Autosomal recessive inheritance``
- ``CLIN_SIG`` - clinical significance, e.g. ``Pathogenic``, or ``Likely benign``

The following headers are optional:

- ``clinvar_accession`` - ClinVar SCV accession if any exists yet.
  When this is set then this variant will be updated in the batch rather than added as a novel variant.
- ``CLIN_EVAL`` - date of late clinical evaluation, e.g. ``2022-12-02``, leave empty to fill with the date of today
- ``CLIN_COMMENT`` - a comment on the clinical significance, e.g., ``ACMG Class IV; PS3, PM2_sup, PP4``
- ``KEY`` - a local key to identify the variant/condition pair.
  Filled automatically with a UUID if missing, recommeded to leave empty.
- ``HPO`` - List of HPO terms separated by comma or semicolon, any space will be stripped.
  E.g., ``HP:0004322; HP:0001263``.

Any further header will be imported into the local repository into an ``extra_data`` field.
Note that the error returned by ClinVar for your variant will be writen to a ``error_msg`` field.

-------------------------------
Structural Variant TSV (Native)
-------------------------------

TBD

------------
Deletion TSV
------------

The following headers are required.
Clinvar-this will recognize the TSV file format based on these headers.

- ``SCV`` - the ClinVar accession to be deleted
- ``COMMENT`` - a free text comment to give to ClinVar as a reason

------------
Phenopackets
------------

TBD

-----------------
Small Variant VCF
-----------------

Note that you cannot mix small and structural variants in one VCF (yet).

Structural Variant VCF

Note that you cannot mix small and structural variants in one VCF (yet).

ClinVar Excel Templates
-----------------------

You already have a process for filling out these ClinVar Excel tables?
You have one filled out already and not submitted before discovering clinvar-this?
This is for you.
