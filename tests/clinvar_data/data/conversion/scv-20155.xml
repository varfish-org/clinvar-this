                <Attribute Type="Description">In 2 French sibs with autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia-48 (SPG48; 613647), Slabicki et al. (2010) identified a homozygous complex insertion/deletion mutation in exon 2 of the KIAA0415 gene. The mutation comprised a 4-bp deletion (80del4) and a 22-bp insertion (84ins22), resulting in a frameshift and premature stop codon following residue 29. The insertion was found to be an imperfect quadruplication of a sequence, suggesting DNA polymerase slippage during DNA synthesis as the pathogenetic mechanism. The patients presented with progressive spastic paraplegia associated with urinary incontinence from ages 50 and 49 years, respectively. One had a normal cerebral MRI, whereas the other had spinal hyperintensities in the cervical spine. The unaffected parents were not known to be consanguineous, but they originated from 2 neighboring villages. The mutation was not found in 156 Caucasian or 242 North African control chromosomes. Studies of lymphoblastoid cells derived from 1 patient showed increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging drugs. The findings suggested a link between this form of spastic paraplegia, which could be considered a neurodegenerative disease, and defects in DNA repair.</Attribute>
